2) Create secret and access key for IAM user (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)

3) Setup your ~/.aws/credentials file with secret and access keys (see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html for details and setup for windows).
